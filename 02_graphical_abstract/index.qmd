## {background-image="content/graphical_abstracts.jpg" background-size="contain"}

## 1: Key message for audience^[@Jambor2024]
### What do you want to show?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/key_message.png)
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- write down the key message in one sentence
- doodle around on paper
- shorten down the abstract to one sentence (conclusion)
- ChatGPT 

### Actionable items
- Take an example of yours and define the key message
:::
::::


## 2: Pictures and pictograms
### Key components are visual elements.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/pictograms.png)
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- mostly pictograms and symbols
- simple shapes
- all icons should have similar overall appearance (consistency)

### Actionable items
- Explore icons: [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com), [Nounproject](https://thenounproject.com), [EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/style-lab/general/fonts/v1.3/), [Bioicons](https://bioicons.com/), [Health Icons](https://healthicons.org/), [Biorender](https://www.biorender.com/)
:::
::::

## 3: Data and charts as key visuals
### When pictograms are not enough.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/chart_types.png)

### Actionable items
- Create minimal chart from your key results
- Explore chart types and their use: [Data Visualization Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/)

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Medical, microscopy, or photo **images are often self-explanatory**
- Most of us understand **bar charts** (and pie and line charts) [12, 13, 14]
- **Omit details** (tick marks, legends, labels, ...)
- highlight specific methods with **domain-specific plots** (e.g. t-SNE, Forrest plots, Vulcano)
:::
::::

## 4: Layout: The dimensions
### Where to put what?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/layout.png)

### Actionable items
- Explore typical formats: e.g. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
- Have a look at requirements: e.g. [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/designs/instructions)
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- often square or rectangle (see instructions)
- often shown very small (newsletter, social media, ...)
- often space very limited (grant applications), go wide not high

:::
::::
  
## 5: Layout: Reading directions
### Where is the entry point, how do you scan?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/reading_direction.png)

### Actionable items
- Figure out the reading directions of the latest figures you created
- Where is your entry point?

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- provide clear entry point
- typical direction: left to right, top to bottom
- arrange elements in reading order [15]
- linear processes or workflows work well in linear chain
- parallel layout for contrasting elements
:::
::::

## 6: Connecting the elements
### Arrows and arrangements

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/arrows.png)

### Actionable items
- Explore the arrows and options in your tool of choice
  - Width, arrow heads, curves, ... (e.g. [Biorender](https://www.biorender.com/))
- Explore systems biology graphical annotation [SBGN](https://sbgn.github.io/)

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- arrows connect text, pictograms, images and charts into a sequential narrative (storyline)
- arrows have distinct functions and meaning (be consistent) [16]
- respect domain-specific agreements (e.g. inhibition)
:::
::::

## 7: Text
### Less is more

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/text.png)

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
- graphical abstract should be self-explanatory (without text)
- be consistent (sizes, font-weight, font)
- don't overwhelm or confuse
:::
::::

## 8: Colors
### Colour is a power which directly influences the soul.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/colors.png)

### Actionable items
- Explore tools to select colors or color combinations
    - [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/)
    - [Paletton](https://paletton.com/)
- Reflect your color choices
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

- engage with audience; other functions: highlight, enumerate, group, levels, ...
- consistency in color usage is important (in graphical abstract and manuscript)
- many people are colorblind
:::
::::


## 9: Tools for graphical abstracts
### Select the right tool for the job.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/biorender.png)

### Actionable items
- Get comfortable with a vector graphics program and start designing
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

- use vector graphics
- Biorender, Canva, Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Incscape
- Comprehensive reviews of features and pricing are available [31, 32]
:::
::::

## 10: Before, during, after
### Feedback

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](content/feedback.png)

### Actionable items
- Get feedback on your last figure and implement the suggestions
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

- designing is an iterative process
- Seek input from friends and colleages.

    Graphical Abstract: A graphical abstract (GA) is an image that appears beneath the text abstract. In addition to summarizing the content, it should represent the topic of the article in an attention-grabbing way. Moreover, before you submit any figures for the graphical abstract, please check the following list to ensure your files meet MDPI’s graphical abstract (GA) criteria:
        A graphical abstract should not be exactly the same as any figure in the body of the paper, a simple superposition of several subfigures, or a combination of the text abstract and a picture.
        A graphical abstract should be original and unpublished artwork. Any postage stamps, currency from any country, or trademarked items should not be included in it. No copyrighted material should be used in a GA.
        A graphical abstract should be a high-quality illustration or diagram in any of the following file formats: PNG, JPEG, or TIFF.
        The minimum required size for the graphical abstract is 560 × 1100 pixels (height × width).
        Written text in a graphical abstract should be clear and easy to read. It is recommended to use fonts such as Times, Arial, Courier, Helvetica, Ubuntu, and Calibri.
        Please use symbols correctly, and do not use commas instead of decimal points in numbers.
        Avoid large blocks of text or large blank spaces in the image.
        Do not include “Graphical Abstract” as a heading in the image.

The graphical abstract will be displayed on the online version of the article, but is typically absent from the print version or article PDF file.

Start with the message
- Define 1 main take‑home message, plus at most 2–3 key findings to show; everything else is background noise.
- Sketch a tiny thumbnail first (paper + pencil) to plan the flow: left‑to‑right or top‑to‑bottom “problem → method → key result → implication.”
Keep design extremely simple
- Use a clean layout with few elements, lots of white space, and a clear visual hierarchy so it is understandable in 3–5 seconds.
- Avoid clutter: no detailed datasets, long legends, or multiple complex graphs; show only representative icons, arrows, and 1–2 simplified plots if essential.
Use consistent visuals
- Choose a limited color palette (2–3 main colors + neutrals) and 1–2 simple sans‑serif fonts; keep line widths and icon styles consistent.
- Reuse the same color or icon for the same concept throughout so readers can follow the logic quickly.
Integrate text sparingly
- Use short labels, not sentences: keywords, 2–4 word phrases, or at most 1–2 bullet points of 10–12 words each.
