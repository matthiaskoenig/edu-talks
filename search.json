The focus is not only on what to do, but how to do it well—across the full research lifecycle.\n\nThe series covers key topics at the intersection of computational biology, statistics, data science, and open science, including:\n\nReproducible and FAIR research workflows\n\nEffective use of public biological and clinical data\n\nSound statistical practice and model evaluation\n\nScientific visualization and graphical abstracts\n\nPosters, presentations, and scientific storytelling\n\nSoftware, code, and workflow sustainability\n\nCollaboration, mentoring, and community building\n\nEach session distills complex experience into ten clear principles, illustrated with real examples, practical recommendations, and common pitfalls. The format is designed to be accessible, discussion-driven, and immediately useful—whether you are early in your career or an experienced researcher refining your practice.\nBy combining methodological rigor with openness, transparency, and clarity, the Ten Simple Rules educational series aims to empower the next generation of scientists to do better, more reproducible, and more impactful research—and to communicate it effectively.",

    "text": "Graphical abstracts have become a central element of modern scientific communication. When done well, they provide a clear, concise, and visually compelling summary of a study’s main message. When done poorly, they can confuse readers, obscure key results, or misrepresent the science.\nThis second session of the Ten Simple Rules Educational Series focuses on how to design effective graphical abstracts that communicate complex ideas with clarity and precision. The session distills practical experience from publications, peer review, and editorial practice into ten simple rules that guide the creation of graphical abstracts that are scientifically accurate, visually coherent, and audience-aware.\nKey topics include: - Defining a single, clear message before starting the design\n- Choosing the right level of abstraction and visual complexity\n- Structuring layouts to guide the reader’s attention\n- Using color, symbols, and typography consistently\n- Avoiding common pitfalls such as visual overload or ambiguous graphics\n- Adapting graphical abstracts to different journals and audiences\nThe session emphasizes that graphical abstracts are not illustrations for experts, but communication tools for a broad scientific audience. Participants will learn how to translate their research into visuals that support understanding, reproducibility, and impact—without oversimplifying the science.\nThis session is aimed at students and researchers across disciplines who want to improve how their work is perceived, understood, and remembered in an increasingly visual scientific landscape.\n\n\n\n Open slides",

    "text": "How to make successful collaborations between computational biologists and experimentalists?\nModern life-science research increasingly depends on close collaboration between computation and experiment. Yet many interdisciplinary projects struggle—not because of missing expertise, but because of mismatched expectations, unclear communication, and poorly aligned workflows.\nThis first session of the Ten Simple Rules Educational Series focuses on the practical foundations of successful collaborations between computational biologists and experimentalists. Drawing on real project experience, the session distills common challenges and proven solutions into ten simple, actionable rules that help interdisciplinary teams work effectively from day one.\nThe session addresses key questions such as: - How can collaborators align scientific questions, assumptions, and success criteria early on? - What should be clarified about data, models, timelines, and responsibilities before a project starts? - How can experimental and computational workflows be connected in a reproducible and transparent way? - How do communication, documentation, and shared language influence long-term success? - What typically goes wrong—and how can it be avoided?\nRather than focusing on tools alone, this session emphasizes people, processes, and shared understanding as the foundation of productive interdisciplinary research. It is aimed at students, PhD candidates, postdocs, and PIs who work—or plan to work—across the boundaries of computation and experiment.\nBy the end of the session, participants will have a clear framework for building collaborations that are trust-based, efficient, reproducible, and scientifically impactful.\n\n\nSlides\n\n Open slides",
