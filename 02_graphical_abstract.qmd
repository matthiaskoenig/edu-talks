# How to create successful graphical abstracts?

Graphical abstracts have become a central element of modern scientific communication. When done well, they provide a **clear, concise, and visually compelling summary** of a study’s main message. When done poorly, they can confuse readers, obscure key results, or misrepresent the science.

This second session of the **Ten Simple Rules Educational Series** focuses on how to design **effective graphical abstracts** that communicate complex ideas with clarity and precision. The session distills practical experience from publications, peer review, and editorial practice into **ten simple rules** that guide the creation of graphical abstracts that are scientifically accurate, visually coherent, and audience-aware.

Key topics include:
- Defining a single, clear message before starting the design  
- Choosing the right level of abstraction and visual complexity  
- Structuring layouts to guide the reader’s attention  
- Using color, symbols, and typography consistently  
- Avoiding common pitfalls such as visual overload or ambiguous graphics  
- Adapting graphical abstracts to different journals and audiences  

The session emphasizes that graphical abstracts are **not illustrations for experts**, but communication tools for a broad scientific audience. Participants will learn how to translate their research into visuals that support understanding, reproducibility, and impact—without oversimplifying the science.

This session is aimed at students and researchers across disciplines who want to improve how their work is perceived, understood, and remembered in an increasingly visual scientific landscape.
