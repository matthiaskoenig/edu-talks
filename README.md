# Ten Simple Rules – An Educational Series for Modern Computational Science

The **Ten Simple Rules** educational series is a curated program designed to support researchers, students, and educators in navigating the practical realities of modern computational and data-driven science.

Building on the well-known *Ten Simple Rules* articles published in *PLOS*, this series translates widely adopted best practices into **concise, actionable guidance** for everyday research, teaching, and collaboration. The focus is not only on *what* to do, but *how* to do it well—across the full research lifecycle.
